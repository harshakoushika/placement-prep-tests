# HashMap (Dictionary)

A HashMap is a data structure that stores data in key–value pairs.

Each key is unique and maps to a specific value.

## Example

Key   → Value  
a     → 1  
b     → 2  
c     → 3

## Python Implementation

In Python, HashMaps are implemented using dictionaries (`dict`).

```python
hashmap = {
    "a": 1,
    "b": 2,
    "c": 3
}
```

### Access element

```python
print(hashmap["a"])   # 1
```

### Add element

```python
hashmap["d"] = 4
```

### Update element

```python
hashmap["a"] = 10
```

### Delete element

```python
del hashmap["b"]
```

## HashMap for Counting (Most Common Use)

Used to count frequency of elements.

### Example

```python
s = "hello"

freq = {}

for ch in s:
    freq[ch] = freq.get(ch, 0) + 1

print(freq)
```

### Output

```
{
'h':1,
'e':1,
'l':2,
'o':1
}
```

---

## Using Counter (Shortcut)

Python provides a built-in frequency counter.

```python
from collections import Counter

s = "hello"
freq = Counter(s)

print(freq)
```

### Output

```
Counter({'l': 2, 'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'o': 1})
```

---

## Iterating Through HashMap

### Keys

```python
for key in hashmap:
    print(key)
```

### Values

```python
for value in hashmap.values():
    print(value)
```

### Key and Value

```python
for key, value in hashmap.items():
    print(key, value)
```

## Time Complexity

| Operation | Complexity |
|----------|------------|
| Insert | O(1) |
| Delete | O(1) |
| Search | O(1) |

Average case complexity is constant time.

## Common Interview Uses

- Frequency counting  
- Detect duplicates  
- Two Sum problem  
- Group anagrams  
- Character counting in strings  
- Hashing based lookups  

---

## Example Problem

Count characters in a string.

```python
s = "banana"

freq = {}

for ch in s:
    freq[ch] = freq.get(ch, 0) + 1

print(freq)
```

### Output

```
{
'b':1,
'a':3,
'n':2
}
```
